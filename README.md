# 🔍 Chess Coach

This project, was born as the requirement of my friends and i, in order not don't behave like apes during the process of discussing plays and moves on specific chess scenarios.
As the result, i came up with the idea of building a paralel board that mirrors what is happening on specific moves on a game.
The codes are extracted from "chess.com" games URL's.
